[AA228/CS238: Decision Making under Uncertainty](https://aa228.stanford.edu), Autumn 2020, Stanford University.

This repository provides starter code and data for Projects 1 and 2.


## Project 1: Bayesian Structure Learning

[![Project 1 Details](https://img.shields.io/badge/project1-details-blue)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/cgi-bin/wp/project-1/) [![Project 1 Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/project1-LaTeX%20template-white)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxwgtnksxtts)

[LaTeX Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxwgtnksxtts): click the link, go to "Menu", and "Copy Project" (make sure you're signed into Overleaf). Note this is an optional template, you're free to use your own (or not even LaTeX).

Notes:
- The starter code is there to help, but you're free to use any language.
- Use `example.gph` to validate your Bayesian scoring algorithm, not your structured learning algorithm.

#### Graph Plotting
Here are some resources for plotting graphs in Julia, Python, and MATLAB.
- Julia:
    - `TikzGraphs.jl` https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JuliaTeX/TikzGraphs.jl/blob/master/doc/TikzGraphs.ipynb
    - `GraphPlot.jl` https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphPlot.jl
- Python:
    - `NetworkX` https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html
- MATLAB:
    - `GraphPlot` https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chart.primitive.graphplot.html

Here's a minimum working example using `TikzGraphs.jl` in Julia:
```julia
using LightGraphs  # for DiGraph and add_edge!
using TikzGraphs   # for TikZ plot output
using TikzPictures # to save TikZ as PDF

g = DiGraph(2) # create a directed graph
add_edge!(g, 1, 2) # add edge from node 1 to node 2

p = plot(g, ["First", "Second"]) # create TikZ plot with labels
save(PDF("graph.pdf"), p) # save TikZ as PDF
```

## Project 2: Reinforcement Learning

[LaTeX Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gsptsmcrzpdv): click the link, go to "Menu", and "Copy Project" (make sure you're signed into Overleaf). Note this is an optional template, you're free to use your own (or not even LaTeX).
